              <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'</p>

            <h3 id="chapters">Chapters in this book:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Chapter 1: <a href="#chapter-1">Down the Rabbit-Hole</a></li>
              <li>Chapter 2: <a href="#chapter-2">The Pool of Tears</a></li>
              <li>Chapter 3: <a href="#chapter-3">A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</a></li>
              <li>Chapter 4: <a href="#chapter-4">The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</a></li>
              <li>Chapter 5: <a href="#chapter-5">Advice from a Caterpillar</a></li>
            </ul>              
              
            <h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>  
            <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

                <img alt="A white rabbit in a hat" src="//placehold.it/800x460/eeeeee/ffffff" data-echo="images/samples/aiw-3.jpg" height='460' width='800' class="lazy">

            <figcaption>An original illustration from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, drawn by John Tenniel.</figcaption>

            <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
            
            <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

            <h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2: The Pool of Tears</h2>  
            <p>'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).</p>
             
            <p>'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'</p>
            
            <p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p>

            <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
            
            <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p>
